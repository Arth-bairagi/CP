I am again starting my competitive programming journey  again from today 
I wish my self all the best 
I will beat everyone , I will beat myself first 

so I left Striver's playlist midway because of collage and so many other things going in my life but now i am going to continue everything i have skipped .

so in this repo i am going to admit my programming experience and all the problems i'm facing right now in my journey .
